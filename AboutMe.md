## ABOUT ME 
My name is Justin Long, i got interested in computer science and software development because i think that they are literally just cool, ive always loved making things with computers whether or be art or id use like scratch and some weird coding app on my phone to make 
my own silly little games. Its just something ive been interested in for a long time
## WHAAT I WANNA LEARN FROM THESE CLASSES
I hope to learn how to make my own games and websites from software development, the idea of being able to make something and see it come to life or be used by others is just such a cool thought to me, defitnley something id like to see in the future.
As for cybersecurity i hope to learn simply how to make my programs safer, i can only imagine what its like to work on something for a uber long time and have some hacker just swoop in and all your work is ruined and theres simply nothing you can do about it.
## INTERESTS OUTSIDE OF COMPUTERS
Outside of computers im a Chess player, i wouldnt say im good compared to the top guys such as Hikaru or Magnus, but im decent, certainly not bad at the game.
Im also a massive WWE fan thanks to my dad, he made me watch two matches of Wrestlemania 40 when it went live, they were both night 2 matches, it was Randy Orton, Kevin Owens and Logan Paul for the United States championship and the main event Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE Universal title Cody winning and dethroning Reigns and ending a Historic streak
